## Last Colony (HTML5 game)
Originally created by [Aditya Ravi Shankar](http://adityaravishankar.com/pro-html5-games/). Refactored by [volodalexey](https://github.com/volodalexey) to use modern javascript and Node.js features.

### Setup

Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)

Navigate to project folder
```bash
cd path/to/project/folder
```

Download all node modules
```bash
npm i
```

run node server
```bash
node server.js
```

Navigate to [localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181) in your browser

### Multiplayer

Basically it is possible to play muiltiplayer game only if all peers are at the same network. In this case you have to find out IP of Node.JS server and connect to it in browser by typing IP:port (e.g. http://192.168.1.101:8181/).
